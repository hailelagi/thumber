# Thumber

Small, distributed elixir HTTPS microservice for image manipulation processing. Thumber uses [thumbelina](https://github.com/hailelagi/thumbelina) underneath for the core image processing operations.

## HTTP API

Thumber is similar to and inspired by [imaginary](https://github.com/h2non/imaginary) but only provides a limited sub-set
of functionality [for now].

## Supported image operations

- Resize
- Enlarge
- Crop
- Rotate
- Thumbnail
